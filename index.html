DEFINITION:
</H1>
<p>
In Europe, the term is "medicinal product", and it is defined by EU law as: "Any substance or combination of substances presented as having properties for treating or preventing disease in human beings; or

 Any substance or combination of substances which may be used in or administered to human beings either with a view to restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions by exerting a pharmacological, immunological or metabolic action, or to making a medical diagnosis."

In the US, a "drug" is:<br>

A substance recognized by an official pharmacopoeia or formulary.<br>
A substance intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.<br>
A substance (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.<br>
A substance intended for use as a component of a medicine but not a device or a component, part or accessory of a device.<br>
Biological products are included within this definition and are generally covered by the same laws and regulations, but differences exist regarding their manufacturing processes (chemical process versus biological process).<br>

USAGE:
</H1>
<p>
Drug use among elderly Americans has been studied; in a group of 2377 people with average age of 71 surveyed between 2005 and 2006, 84% took at least one prescription drug, 44% took at least one over-the-counter (OTC) drug, and 52% took at least one dietary supplement; in a group of 2245 elderly Americans (average age of 71) surveyed over the period 2010 â€“ 2011, those percentages were 88%, 38%, and 64%.

Drug discovery:
</H1>
<p>
In the fields of medicine, biotechnology and pharmacology, drug discovery is the process by which new drugs are discovered.

Historically, drugs were discovered through identifying the active ingredient from traditional remedies or by serendipitous discovery. Later chemical libraries of synthetic small molecules, natural products or extracts were screened in intact cells or whole organisms to identify substances that have a desirable therapeutic effect in a process known as classical pharmacology. Since sequencing of the human genome which allowed rapid cloning and synthesis of large quantities of purified proteins, it has become common practice to use high throughput screening of large compounds libraries against isolated biological targets which are hypothesized to be disease modifying in a process known as reverse pharmacology. Hits from these screens are then tested in cells and then in animals for efficacy. Even more recently, scientists have been able to understand the shape of biological molecules at the atomic level, and to use that knowledge to design (see drug design) drug candidates.

Modern drug discovery involves the identification of screening hits, medicinal chemistry and optimization of those hits to increase the affinity, selectivity (to reduce the potential of side effects), efficacy/potency, metabolic stability (to increase the half-life), and oral bioavailability. Once a compound that fulfills all of these requirements has been identified, it will begin the process of drug development prior to clinical trials. One or more of these steps may, but not necessarily, involve computer-aided drug design.

Despite advances in technology and understanding of biological systems, drug discovery is still a lengthy, "expensive, difficult, and inefficient process" with low rate of new therapeutic discovery. In 2010, the research and development cost of each new molecular entity (NME) was approximately US$1.8 billion. Drug discovery is done by pharmaceutical companies, with research assistance from universities. The "final product" of drug discovery is a patent on the potential drug. The drug requires very expensive Phase I, II and III clinical trials, and most of them fail. Small companies have a critical role, often then selling the rights to larger companies that have the resources to run the clinical trials.

<h2>
Drug pricing:
</h2>
<p>
<b>United Kingdom:</b><br>
In the UK the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme is intended to ensure that the National Health Service is able to purchase drugs at reasonable prices. The prices are negotiated between the Department of Health, acting with the authority of Northern Ireland and the UK Government, and the representatives of the Pharmaceutical industry brands, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI). For 2017 this payment percentage set by the PPRS will be 4,75%.
<br>
<b>Canada:</b><br>
In Canada, the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board examines drug pricing and determines if a price is excessive or not. In these circumstances, drug manufacturers must submit a proposed price to the appropriate regulatory agency. Furthermore, "the International Therapeutic Class Comparison Test is responsible for comparing the National Average Transaction Price of the patented drug product under review"[16] different countries that the prices are being compared to are the following: France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States
<br>
<b>Brazil:</b><br>
In Brazil, the prices are regulated through a legislation under the name of Medicamento GenÃ©rico (generic drugs) since 1999.
<br>
<b>India:</b><br>
In India, drug prices are regulated by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority.
<br>
<b>United States:</b><br>
In the United States, drug costs are unregulated, but instead are the result of negotiations between drug companies and insurance companies.
<br>
High prices have been attributed to monopolies given to manufacturers by the government and a lack of ability for organizations to negotiate prices.
